# Bluff-Game
A two-player card deception game built with Python and Pygame. Each player takes turns playing cards while declaring a card type (Ace, King, Queen, or Jack). The opponent can call a bluff â€” if correct, the bluffer risks Russian Roulette; if wrong, the challenger does. Last player standing wins.
